# Stack,Heap
# Mutable vs Immutable

In Python
    - Lists
    - Sets
    - Dictionaries
    - User-Defined Classes (It purely depends upon the user to define the characteristics) 

- Immutable[state/content not changed] Primitive Data Types<br>
In Python
    - Primitive Data Types
        - Numbers (Integer, Rational, Float, Decimal, Complex & Booleans)
        - Strings
        - Tuples
    - Frozen Sets
    - User-Defined Classes (It purely depends upon the user to define the characteristics)
